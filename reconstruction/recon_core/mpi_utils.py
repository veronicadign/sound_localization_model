MPI and NEURON-mechanism boilerplate.

Every pipeline runs the same way under `mpiexec`: rank 0 extracts spikes from the
`.pic` (a slow, single-writer step), broadcasts the resulting metadata, and all
ranks then simulate their share of the population.  That handshake, and the
"mechanisms may already be loaded" dance NEURON requires when several model
directories are pulled in, were each copied into every entry point.
